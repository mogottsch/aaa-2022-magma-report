%% -------------------------------------- bicycle sharing data
\subsection{Data Collection}
We received bicycle rental data from the bicycle sharing provider NextBike for the city of Leipzig during the year 2019.
% 
The bicycle rental data is available as a snapshot of bicycle locations at the start and end of each trip. Additionally, locations at the beginning and end of each day are provided. For two consecutive days, these are only one second apart. However, there is often a difference in distance of multiple kilometers between them, which would be impossible to travel in one second.
% The bicycle rental data is available as a snapshot of bicycle locations at the start and end of a trip as well as the first and last second of a day.
% The last location of a bicycle at a given day is, temporally, only one second apart from the first location of the consecutive day.
% However, that these locations often differ by multiple kilometres, which is impossible to travel in one second.
Therefore, we assume that the first and last entry of a day are not actually one second apart but instead represent relocations that happened at another time. To clean the data, we remove all samples that are not in the time interval from 01.01.2019 to 31.12.2019, as we only analyse the year 2019. Additionally, we compare bicycle locations with the official NextBike flexzone to eliminate samples with erroneous GPS data. The results show, that over \(70\%\) of all samples lie outside of the flexzone. As it is very unlikely that so many samples are erroneous, we decided to add a 10km buffer to the flexzone, so that only samples that are really far away are removed.

%% -------------------------------------- weather data
We have also collected hourly weather data, such as temperature, precipitation, cloud coverage and wind speed. Our selection is based on the approach taken by \shortciteA{schroer2022data}, who used these features in their research on repositioning in on-demand vehicle sharing systems. For this purpose we used the open portal of the German Weather Service \shortcite{german_weather_service}. 
% Additionally information about the hourly weather was added to the trip data. For this we included the meteorological features temperature, precipitation, cloud cover and wind speed. This selection is based on the approach taken by \shortciteA{schroer2022data} who used these features for bike sharing predictive analytics. Source of the data is the open data portal of the German Weather service\footnote{\url{https://opendata.dwd.de}}. The weather data then got merged to the trips utilizing the timestamp.

%% -------------------------------------- landuse data
Additionally, we gathered the land use data, \shortcite{copernicus_land_use}
% We further added land use data to both the trips and the hexagons in all resolutions.
% For this, we downloaded the land use data set for Leipzig from the Kopernikus website \shortcite{copernicus_land_use}.
% For individual trips, we merged this on the start and end location. For hexagons, we calculated for each hexagon which percentage of the area represents which land use type.

%% -------------------------------------- trips calculation
\subsection{Trips Calculation}
To generate trips from bicycle locations we designed the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sort all samples by time
    \item Group all samples by the bicycle id
    \item Create tuples with of each two consecutive location of each bicycle
    \item Classify tuples as trips or relocations
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Figures/trip_creation_diagram.pdf}
    \caption{Trip Creation (trips marked in blue)}
    \label{fig:trip_creation}
\end{figure}

Our rationale is that every pair of consecutive locations of one bicycle has to be either a trip, a relocation or no movement at all.
As we have the information, whether a given sample is the start of a trip, the end of a trip, the start of a day or the end of the day measurement as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:trip_creation}, we can easily classify each pair of consecutive locations.

We then remove all trips that exceed the speed of 25km/h, which is the limit for e-bikes in Germany \shortcite{giant_bicycles}. Trips that exceed such limit would require a person to cycle faster than the maximum speed of e-bike without any stops during the trip. As this does not seem plausible, we consider these trips faulty.
Also, the distance is measured between the start and the end location, which is a lower bound on the actual distance traveled.
Therefore, the real distance is most likely longer and the real speed is most likely higher.

%% -------------------------------------- demand and availability aggregation
\subsection{Demand And Availability Aggregation}
Next, we aggregate the trips spatially and temporally.
For spatial aggregation we use the Hexagonal Hierarchical Geospatial Indexing System H3 \shortcite{uber_h3_2022}, which partitions the earth into hexagons of varying sizes depending on the chosen resolution.
In our research, we use the resolutions 7, 8 and 9, where the area of one hexagons covers between \(0.1\) km\(^2\) and \(5\) km\(^2\).
Additionally, we aggregate trips across multiple time intervals of lengths 1, 2, 6 and 24 hours.


\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ c|c|c|c }
        star hexagon id & end hexagon id & time interval & \# starting trips (demand) \\
        \hline
        1               & 2              & 2             & 7                          \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Sample of aggregated trip data}
    \label{table:aggregated_trips}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:aggregated_trips} shows a sample of the data that results from this aggregation, which states, for example, that 7 trips started during time interval 2 inside the hexagon with id 1 and ended in the hexagon with id 2.
Real h3 ids actually are in the form of Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), but we've replaced them here with numeric ids for the sake of readability.
Later we will also use an even more aggregated form of this data, which does not have end hexagon ids.



We also want to aggregate the availability of bicycles in each hexagon at a given time.
For this purpose, we first set the availability of a given hexagon at a given time interval to the number of bicycles whose first seen locations are there.
Then, we update the availability of the hexagons with each trip and relocation by subtracting from the availability in the starting hexagon and adding to the end hexagon.
When a bicycle reaches its final location, it is subtracted from the availability.
Following this approach the availability can be expressed more formally as
\[A(h, t) = A(h, t-1) + s_t(h) - d_t(h) \delta_t^+(h) - \delta_t^-(h)\]
where \(A(h, t)\) describes the total number of available bicycles at hexagon \(h\) at time interval \(t\),
\(\delta_t^+(h)\) and \(\delta_t^-(h)\) describe the total number of incoming and outgoing trips and relocations in time interval \(t\) considering hexagon \(h\),
\(s_t(h)\) describes the number of bicycles that "spawn" (first observation) in hexagon \(h\) at time interval \(t\) and
\(d_t(h)\) describes the number of bicycles that "vanish" (last observation) in hexagon \(h\) at time interval \(t\).
