\section{Descriptive Analysis}
\label{sec:descriptive_analysis}

We split our descriptive analysis into two parts.
First, we analyze the trips in different forms, such as demand, availability and
idle time along multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Then we analyse the
relationships between trips and other influencing factors, such as weather,
land use and points of interests.


\subsection{Spatial And Temporal Analysis Of Trips}
\label{subsec:descriptive_analysis_spatial_temporal}

In order to get a better understanding on where possible hot spots of bicycle
demand and availability in the system are, we create and investigate choropleth maps,
where we aggregate demand and availability by h3 hexagons.
First we plot the total flow of bicycles, that is the sum of all incoming and
outgoing trips. This can help us to identify hot spots.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    % \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/descriptive_analysis/total_flow.pdf}
    \caption{Total Flow Of Bicycles Per Hexagon}
    \label{fig:descriptive_analysis_total_flow}
\end{figure}

With the plot as seen in figure \ref{fig:descriptive_analysis_total_flow} we
can already hotpsots in the center of city, where the train station as well as
the most shopping areas are, as well as a cluster of high flow hexagons in the
west and east of the city, where residential areas are.
We also see that the the hexagons around the borders of the city have very low flow. This shows that it is possible to satisfy a large portion of the demand by just focusing on the hot spots, which is an important consideration when entering the shared mobility market.

Next, we will analyze the net flow of bicycles per hexagon, which is the
difference between incoming and outgoing trips. This measure is highly relevant
for the bicycle sharing system operator, as it shows imbalances in the system.
Imbalances occur when the number of trips that end are less or more than the
number of trips that start in a certain hexagon. This can lead to unmet demand
and therefore inefficient usage of resources. The result of such an analysis
can be used to perform effective relocations.

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}

        \label{fig:descriptive_analysis_net_flow_original}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        % \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/descriptive_analysis/net_flow_rescaled.pdf}
        \caption{Adapted Scale}
        \label{fig:descriptive_analysis_net_flow_rescaled}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Net Flow Of Bicycles Per Hexagon}
    \label{fig:descriptive_analysis_net_flow}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:descriptive_analysis_net_flow_original} shows the net flow of
bicycles per hexagon. Wee see that the net flow for the hexagon next to the
main train station is a large negative number, which means that more trips
start than end there. The bicycle operator needs to relocate bicycles to that
hexagon, in order to avoid unmet demand.
As the net flow for main train station hexagon is so large, the color scale is
so wide that we can barely see any other imbalances.
Therefore, we adjust the color scale to also see smaller imbalances.

With the adjusted color scale as seen in figure
\ref{fig:descriptive_analysis_net_flow_rescaled} we see more imbalances,
especially in the center of the city.

TODO (trips per month)


Next we will analyse the idle time of bicycles. The idle time is the time
between two consecutive trips with the same bicycle. It is an important measure
for the bicycle sharing system operator as it might indicate and oversaturation
of demand. Also unusual high idle times of single bicycles can be a sign of
anomalies in the system, such as damaged or hidden bicycles.


Figure \ref{fig:descriptive_analysis_idle_time_daily} shows the median idle time of bicycles per day.
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/descriptive_analysis/idle_time_daily.pdf}
    \caption{Median Idle Time Of Bicycles Per Day}
    \label{fig:descriptive_analysis_idle_time_daily}
\end{figure}

We can see that the median idle time of bicycles slowly decreases until around
June and then it stays constant with a few outliers. We suspect that the
operators changed their strategy by, for example, managing the fleet size more
actively or performing relocations from regions
with a higher idle time.

To further give concrete advise for relocations, we plot the median idle time
of bicycles per hexagon to identify critical regions with high idle times.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/descriptive_analysis/idle_time_hexagon.pdf}
    \caption{Median Idle Time Of Bicycles Per Hexagon}
    \label{fig:descriptive_analysis_idle_time_hexagon}
\end{figure}

Wee see... TODO


An interactive map of the median idle time per hexagon for each month can be
found in our notebooks.

Lastly, we will also analyse the availability of bicycles. The availability,
similar to identifying hot spots and imbalances, can help to identify regions
with oversaturated or undersaturated demand and is therefore important for
optimization of the system.


\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/descriptive_analysis/availability_per_hexagonpdf}
    \caption{Availability Per Hexagon}
    \label{fig:descriptive_analysis_availability_per_hexagon}
\end{figure}

We see a few hexagon with high availability, three of them are around the main
train station, but the one with the highest availability is in the west. To
understand the cause for this increased availability better we reviewed our
land use data for this specific hexagon and found that the hexagon mostly
consists of "continous urban fabric". Looking at the area with Google Street
View also revealed that the area mostly consists of residential buildings.
Eventhough, we would expect a hexagon with high availability to have a higher
inflow than outflow and/or a higher idle time of bicycles, we do not see any
evidence for this. Therefore the high availability has to be caused by a constant,
regular and balanced inflow and outflow of bicycles, which is very good in
terms of efficiency. It might be that people living in the area around often
use bicycles to get to work and back, which would result in a balanced flow.
