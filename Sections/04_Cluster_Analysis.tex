\section{Clustering}
\label{sec:clustering}

In order to identify patterns in the trip data, we clustered trips using kmeans++ and gaussian mixture models. This can help in identifying local hotspots or recurring trips types such as commutes or leisure trips. 

Kmeans++ is a hard clustering algorithm that assigns each data point to a definite cluster. Due to the way it computes clusters, clusters are limited to convex shapes. Gaussian mixture models, on the other hand,
